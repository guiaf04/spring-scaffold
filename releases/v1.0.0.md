# Release Notes - Spring Scaffold CLI v1.0.0

**Release Date**: August 22, 2025

## 🎯 Release Summary

The **initial release** of Spring Scaffold CLI introduces the foundation for Java and Spring Boot application scaffolding. This version establishes the CLI structure and basic functionality, with the model command being fully operational.

## ✨ **Features**

### 🚀 **CLI Foundation**
- Complete command-line interface using Picocli
- Structured command architecture for extensibility
- Comprehensive help system with examples
- Color-coded output for better user experience

### 📋 **Model Command (Fully Functional)**
```bash
spring-scaffold model User --fields "name:String,email:String,age:Integer"
```

**Generates:**
- JPA entity classes with proper annotations
- Lombok integration for reduced boilerplate
- Configurable package structure
- Bean Validation annotations (optional)

### 🏗️ **Template Engine**
- Mustache template integration
- Flexible template system for code generation
- Support for variable substitution
- Extensible for future template types

### 🔧 **Utility Infrastructure**
- FileUtils for file operations
- NamingUtils for consistent naming conventions
- Validation utilities for input checking
- Logging framework integration

## ⚠️ **Known Limitations**

### **Simulation-Only Commands**
The following commands are implemented but only simulate file generation:
- `controller` - Logs success but doesn't create files
- `service` - Logs success but doesn't create files  
- `repository` - Logs success but doesn't create files
- `project` - Logs success but doesn't create files

**Status Messages:**
These commands will show success messages like:
```
✅ Controller UserController generated successfully!
📁 Location: ./com/example/controller/UserController.java
```

But no actual files are created. This will be fixed in v2.0.0.

## 🏗️ **Architecture**

### **Command Structure**
```
SpringScaffoldCLI (main)
├── ModelCommand ✅ (functional)
├── ControllerCommand ⚠️ (simulation only)
├── ServiceCommand ⚠️ (simulation only)
├── RepositoryCommand ⚠️ (simulation only)
└── ProjectCommand ⚠️ (simulation only)
```

### **Generator Pattern**
Each command follows a consistent pattern:
1. Input validation
2. Parameter processing
3. Template preparation
4. File generation (where implemented)
5. User feedback

### **Template System**
- Mustache templates in `src/main/resources/templates/`
- Context objects for template data
- Reusable template components

## 📁 **Assets**

- **spring-scaffold.jar** - Main executable (Java 17+)
- **Source Code** - Complete source with examples

## 🔧 **Installation**

```bash
# Download
wget https://github.com/guiaf04/spring-scaffold/releases/download/v1.0.0/spring-scaffold.jar

# Make executable
chmod +x spring-scaffold.jar

# Test with functional command
java -jar spring-scaffold.jar model TestModel --fields "name:String"
```

## 📊 **What Works**

### ✅ **Fully Functional**
- Model/Entity generation with complete files
- Help system and command documentation
- Input validation and error handling
- Template processing for models

### ⚠️ **Simulation Only**
- Controller generation (logs only)
- Service generation (logs only)
- Repository generation (logs only)
- Project scaffolding (logs only)

## 🎯 **Use Cases**

### **Current (v1.0.0)**
```bash
# Generate JPA entities
spring-scaffold model User --fields "name:String,email:String"
spring-scaffold model Product --fields "name:String,price:BigDecimal"
```

### **Coming in v2.0.0**
- Complete CRUD generation
- Full project scaffolding
- Service and controller implementations
- Repository interfaces with queries

## 🚀 **Roadmap**

### **v2.0.0 (Next Release)**
- ✅ Implement real file generation for all commands
- ✅ Complete template implementations
- ✅ Full project scaffolding capability
- ✅ Production-ready code generation

### **Future Versions**
- Enhanced template customization
- Multiple framework support
- IDE integration
- Advanced configuration options

## 🐛 **Known Issues**

1. **Commands show success but don't generate files** (except model)
   - Workaround: Use only model command for now
   - Fix: Coming in v2.0.0

2. **Limited template functionality**
   - Workaround: Manually create additional files
   - Fix: Complete templates in v2.0.0

3. **Basic error handling**
   - Workaround: Validate inputs manually
   - Fix: Enhanced validation in v2.0.0

## 📖 **Documentation**

- [README.md](README.md) - Basic usage guide
- Command help: `java -jar spring-scaffold.jar <command> --help`

## 🎉 **Acknowledgments**

This initial release establishes the foundation for a powerful Spring Boot scaffolding tool. While limited in functionality, it provides a solid base for rapid development in future versions.

**📋 Note: This is a foundation release. Use only the model command for actual file generation until v2.0.0.**
